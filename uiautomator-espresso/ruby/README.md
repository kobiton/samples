# Ruby samples using UIAutomator/ Espresso framework

## I. Setup environment on Mac

#### rvm

- [rvm](https://rvm.io/) is a Ruby Version Manager for the Mac.
-  To install rvm, open terminal and type the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
```
- Once this command has finished running you may need to restart your terminal for rvm to be recognised.

- To check the version, type the following command:

```bash
ruby -v
```

#### Install Ruby version 2.4.1

- To install ruby via rvm, type the following command:

```bash
rvm install ruby-2.4.1
```

- If you want to set this version of Ruby as the default version, in terminal type:

```bash
rvm --default use 2.4.1
```
